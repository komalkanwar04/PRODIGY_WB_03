This Tic Tac Toe game is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that offers a delightful interactive experience. The game interface includes a grid of 3x3 squares where players can click to place their X or O. Each move triggers dynamic CSS animations, highlighting the chosen square and smoothly transitioning between turns.
JavaScript manages the game mechanics, ensuring each move is validated and updating the display to reflect the current state of play. It tracks the progress of the game, checking for winning conditions such as three consecutive X's or O's in a row, column, or diagonal. When a player wins, the game announces the winner and offers a replay button to start a new round. Also, the name of players can be set accordingly.
The design is responsive, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes, and features a clean, minimalist aesthetic with subtle visual cues to guide players through the gameplay. Overall, it's a modern take on a timeless game, blending functionality with visual appeal for an engaging user experience.
